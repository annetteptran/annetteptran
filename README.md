# Annette Tran

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Houston with a strong interest in software engineering, AI/ML, and building practical, efficient systems. I enjoy learning new technologies, creating user-focused applications, and solving problems through clean and thoughtful design.

I’m motivated by growth and enjoy taking on projects that challenge what I already know. I focus on staying curious, improving consistently, and building work I can be proud of :)
